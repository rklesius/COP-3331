These solutions were written and built in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.  

GradedActivity.h is the parent class of Essay.h and EssayDriver.cpp is the driver program for the two class files.  They all need to be compiled
together in order for this program to work.  

There are no further compiling instructions beyond opening the file in the IDE, going to file -> new -> project from existing code
and then selecting visual c++, clicking next, and searching for the file within your computer.  From there, go to build -> build solution
and then hit ctrl + F5 on your keyboard to run the program.  

Thank you for your time,
