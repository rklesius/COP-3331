These solutions were written and built in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.  

To use Random.txt in the program, you must go to the project file and place it in the second folder that shares the
name of your project. (You’ll know you’re in the right location if the source code is
already there.) 

There are no further compiling instructions beyond opening the file in the IDE, going to file -> new -> project from existing code
and then selecting visual c++, clicking next, and searching for the file within your computer.  From there, go to build -> build solution
and then hit ctrl + F5 on your keyboard to run the program.  

Thank you for your time,
