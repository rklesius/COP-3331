These solutions were written and built in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.  

There are no further compiling instructions beyond opening the file in the IDE, going to file -> new -> project from existing code
and then selecting visual c++, clicking next, and searching for the file within your computer.  From there, go to build -> build solution
and then hit ctrl + F5 on your keyboard to run the program.  

Thank you for your time,
